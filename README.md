# welcome.js

**welcome.js** is a tiny JavaScript file you can add to any web page to help novice users get the most out of the web.

## Being Welcoming

The web is an amazing technology, and people can get even more out if it by understanding how to use it better, how it's built, and even how to build it themselves.

This takes specialised knowledge, and the discovery of the developer console is the way many people first start learning about the web.

**welcome.js** adds a friendly message to the console when it's first opened, as well as links for [users](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/turing-complete-user/) to find out more about the console, and programming in general.

## Demo

## Installing

Place the `welcome.js` file on your server, and add the following line (with the correct path) anywhere on your page, preferably at the end just before `</body>`.

```html
<script src="welcome.js"></script>
```

### Hosting and Distribution

## Feedback

Please feel free to send comments, requests, and issues. In particular, suggestions for better and more helpful links are welcome.

## Background

**welcome.js** was inspired by the use on certain websites of aggressive warnings in the console, which might appear frightening and off-putting to inexperienced users.
